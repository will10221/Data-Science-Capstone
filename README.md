# Portfolio Construction and Optimization
Data Science Capstone
Equity Portfolio Construction, Optimization, and Performance Analysis using Machine Learning


The goal of this project is to use sentiment and technical data to predict the outcome of the top 50 stocks by volume in the S&P 500 index. Data collected was between the period of 2016-2021. The semantic data consisted of 500,000 tweets which we ran an analysis on to determine whether it was positive, neutral, or negative. This data was inputted into Long Short Term and Gated Recurrent Unit models and tuned. These models were then trained and evaluated. The full report can be found in the "Report" folder of the repository.
